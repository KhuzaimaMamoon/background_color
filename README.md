This repository contains a simple web application that enables users to change the background color of a webpage by clicking on buttons representing different colors.

How to Use
Select a Color: Click on any of the colored buttons displayed on the page. Each button corresponds to a different color.

Change Background Color: Upon clicking a button, the background color of the webpage will change to the selected color.

Implementation Details
HTML: The index.html file contains the structure of the webpage.
CSS: The styling for the webpage is defined in the style.css file.
JavaScript: The functionality of changing the background color is implemented in the script.js file using JavaScript.
